# About Me

### A Texas man born in Venezuela and living in Maryland

Hello! My name is Domingo Salerno, I am a budding data scientist, and I am currently in the MS in Data Science program offered by American University. I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in 2018 having studied political science, with a focus in electoral processes and European Union politics. Since then, I have worked in the insurance and automotive industries in positions that demanded excellent teamwork, constant organization, and clear communication with management and clients. My work experience has provided me with the investigative, organizational, and time management skills that have prepared me for any challenge that I may face.

In the Spring of 2020, my innate curiosity led me to discover the wide world that is data science. I felt compelled to learn more, and I started taking courses online almost immediately. I took R courses that covered data manipulation with dplyr, creating visualizations with ggplot2, formatting and reporting using markdown, writing functions, and performing statistical regression analysis. I also taught myself Python, taking courses on data manipulation with pandas, data visualization with matplotlib and seaborn, error-handling. I also wrote functions, iterators, list comprehensions, and generators.

Lately, I have been volunteering at Penn State University on a variety of linguistic research projects. I have included samples of my contributions in the research-at-penn-state-university repository on my page. I am also applying to graduate school with the intent of formally studying data science and learning the tools I will need to build the career of my dreams. I want to utilize the power of data and collaborate with leaders of this field to drive innovative solutions and insights that will revolutionize our understanding of electoral campaigns and strategies.

When I am not studying or working, you will most likely find me playing guitar, watching sports, or playing computer games. There are few things that bring me as much joy as playing a song I love and really getting into a groove. One of my favorite things about music is how it brings together people with unique experiences and perspectives, and blends their individual sounds together to create something new and collaborative. While music speaks to the creative in me, sports and computer games speak to the nerd in me. I love thinking about the fundamentals of how games work, how strategies and tactics are developed with certain goals in mind, and how one always needs to be adaptable to changing circumstances. These are just a few of the things that make me who I am!
