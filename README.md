# About Me

### A Texas man born in Venezuela and living in Maryland

Hello! My name is Domingo Salerno, I am a budding data scientist, and I am very excited to have finished the MS in Dats Science program offered by American University in May 2023! I graduated from the University of Texas at Austin in 2018 having studied political science, with a focus in electoral processes and European Union politics. Since then, I have worked in the insurance and automotive industries in positions that demanded excellent teamwork, constant organization, and clear communication with management and clients. My work experience has provided me with the investigative, organizational, and time management skills that have prepared me for any challenge that I may face.

During my time at American University, I immersed myself in advanced statistical programming using R, gaining a solid foundation in data manipulation and visualization. Additionally, courses in statistical methods and regression provided me with the analytical expertise to draw meaningful insights from complex datasets. Software engineering taught me how to develop efficient and scalable data applications, while delving into the realm of artificial intelligence led to me developing a thorough understanding of various algorithms and search methods.

Moreover, my exposure to statistical machine learning and deep learning/neural networks further strengthened my ability to tackle real-world challenges through predictive modeling and pattern recognition. Notably, the culmination of my studies was a practicum where I successfully leveraged clustering techniques to categorize survey participants based on their responses to psychological questionnaires, showcasing my practical expertise in applying data science methodologies to address complex problems.

When I am not studying or working, you will most likely find me playing guitar, watching sports, or playing computer games. There are few things that bring me as much joy as playing a song I love and really getting into a groove. One of my favorite things about music is how it brings together people with unique experiences and perspectives, and blends their individual sounds together to create something new and collaborative. While music speaks to the creative in me, sports and computer games speak to the nerd in me. I love thinking about the fundamentals of how games work, how strategies and tactics are developed with certain goals in mind, and how one always needs to be adaptable to changing circumstances. These are just a few of the things that make me who I am!
